The Scratch trademarks, including the Scratch name, logo, the Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Tera and Giga graphics (the "Marks"), are property of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the use of the Marks is governed by this policy.

You may use the Marks to refer to Scratch in Substantially Unmodified form.

"Substantially Unmodified" means the source code provided by MIT, possibly with minor modifications including but not limited to: bug fixes (including security), changing the locations of files for better integration with the host operating system, adding documentation, and changes to the dynamic linking of libraries.

A version is not "Substantially Unmodified" if it incorporates features not present in a release of Scratch by MIT.  If you do make a substantial modification, to avoid confusion with versions of Scratch produced by MIT you must remove all Marks from your version of the software and refrain from using any of the Marks to refer to your version.
